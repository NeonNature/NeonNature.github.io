			<h2> Minecraft Plugins </h2>
			<img src="" /> 

			<p>
				I used to develop some Java plugins for Minecraft. By following some tutorials, I managed to develop some custom plugins of my own.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the suggestion of a friend, I created <>Super Saiyan<> plugin (from DragonBalls) for Minecraft, with which you can get some buffs when you put on a Golden Helmet (instead of Golden Hair). Inspiring HungerGames I used to play in Minecraft 1.7.10 or so, I created the <>Ninja<> kit plugin in which you can turn invisible when you sneak. As far as I recall, I think there's a plugin with a Stick that shoots out Fireballs or so but I don't remember that name anymore.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, they were all lost in a HDD failure and all that's left are these screenshots I sent to a group. Besides, I'm not that much into Java.
			</p>

			<h2> Mobile Money Website </h2>
			<img src="" />

			<p> 
				A Project created for NCC Edu., (and yea, I would fail if I did not xD) using HTML, PHP and a little bit of CSS (Trust me, I didn't use that much CSS before and I regret that). 
			</p>
			<p>
				This is a web-version of Mobile Money applications with somewhat less complicated Logic. Super Agents will be holding the majority of cash and Agents of several shops/ cities will request some cash from Super Agents (1 per city or so), so that Agents can transfer those cash to Customers. Customer Types such as Golden Customers exist but discounts are yet to be implemented. Note that these accounts need valid Phone number (won't send SMS though) to be created. There might be several stuffs I forgot to mention. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Fortunately, this one was backed up before the HDD failure and I can still show it to those who wish along with documentations and Entity Relationship Diagrams. Not planning to host this using a free Dynamic web host unless requested.
			</p>

			<h2> Quick Clicker </h2>
			<img src=""> 

			<p>
				A <a href="">Cookie Clicker</a> inspired Java game for an assignment. This was the Java project I enjoyed most.
			</p>
			<p>
				So, like Cookie Clicker, you...click in this game. . . to the end. You can also buy upgrades and stuffs to help you reach the goal (and yes, there's an end; a goal unlike Cookie Clicker).
			</p>
			<p>
				This game is still available for those who wanna try. Just shoot a mail or <a href="contact.html">contact me</a>.
			</p>

			<h2> Pokemon Hacked Rom for University </h2>
			<img src="" />

			<p> 
				A project made for fun but never got to continue it. The maps were partially finished and there were no events added yet, nor Pokemon. This can be called a failed attempt but hey, there are screenshots! xD
			</p> 

			<h2> Kirby & Keeby </h2>
			<img src="" />

			<p> 
				Have taken down this webcomic. Used to be on www.kirbyandkeeby.smackjeeves.com (and had 30-ish fans!) 
			</p>
			<p> 
				There were two versions though. One was the original version which I fully deleted everything thinking they are crappy (but turns out that was the worst decision ever) and the screenshots you can see are the "remade" and incomplete versions of them.
			</p>

			<h2> Pokemon Channel...? </h2>
			<img src="" />

			<p> 
				So...I create (or created) Gaming Videos on Youtube and I wouldn't mind if you smash that Subscribe button. You can find the link in <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>.
			</p>

			<h2> This website </h2>
			<img src="" />

			<p> 
				Er...this website. Nuff said.
