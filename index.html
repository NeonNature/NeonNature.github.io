				About Me! 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p align="center">
				Oh, wanna know more than above..? <br><br>
				I'm from Yangon, Myanmar (Burma) (meh, nobody knows it anyway)! I'm neither a gamer nor a developer right now; a hobbyist I am. I do things I want to do and they aren't constant. <br><br>
				I like to procrastinate stuffs and I'm still trying not to be lazy. I like to finish tasks near the deadline and same goes for exams too. <s> Speaking of exams, I'm currently attending 2 Universities.</s> <br><br>
				<s> Why two? Is that even legit? Well, you can say one is government and one is er...public? Global? I chose fame instead of my hobby, and I'm stuck being a Mining Engineer. My parents tried to cheer me up by letting me attend (well, R.I.P. Time) the second University, which is IT..but Business IT. (NCC, google if you want). </s> <br><br>

				My life has changed since that Fateful Day... 16th November, 2017.
